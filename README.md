# RASHCODE

RASHCODE is an open-source coding-agent CLI that works with more than one model provider.

Use OpenAI-compatible APIs, Gemini, GitHub Models, Codex, Ollama, Atomic Chat, and other supported backends while keeping the same terminal-first workflow: prompts, tools, agents, MCP, slash commands, and streaming output.

## Why RASHCODE

- Use one CLI across cloud and local model providers
- Save provider profiles inside the app with `/provider`
- Run locally with Ollama or Atomic Chat
- Keep core coding-agent workflows: bash, file tools, grep, glob, agents, tasks, MCP, and web tools

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm install -g @rashhplap/rashcode
```

If the npm install path later reports `ripgrep not found`, install ripgrep system-wide and confirm `rg --version` works in the same terminal before starting RASHCODE.

### Start

```bash
RASHCODE
```

Inside RASHCODE:

- run `/provider` for guided setup of OpenAI-compatible, Gemini, Ollama, or Codex profiles
- run `/onboard-github` for GitHub Models setup

### Fastest OpenAI setup

macOS / Linux:

```bash
export RASH_CODE_USE_OPENAI=1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o

RASHCODE
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:RASH_CODE_USE_OPENAI="1"
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
$env:OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"

RASHCODE
```

### Fastest local Ollama setup

macOS / Linux:

```bash
export RASH_CODE_USE_OPENAI=1
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
export OPENAI_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder:7b

RASHCODE
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:RASH_CODE_USE_OPENAI="1"
$env:OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434/v1"
$env:OPENAI_MODEL="qwen2.5-coder:7b"

RASHCODE
```

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Setup Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI-compatible | `/provider` or env vars | Works with OpenAI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, LM Studio, and compatible local `/v1` servers |
| Gemini | `/provider` or env vars | Google Gemini support through the runtime provider layer |
| GitHub Models | `/onboard-github` | Interactive onboarding with saved credentials |
| Codex | `/provider` | Uses existing Codex credentials when available |
| Ollama | `/provider` or env vars | Local inference with no API key |
| Atomic Chat | advanced setup | Local Apple Silicon backend |
| Bedrock / Vertex / Foundry | env vars | Additional provider integrations for supported environments |

## What Works

- Tool-driven coding workflows
  Bash, file read/write/edit, grep, glob, agents, tasks, MCP, and slash commands
- Streaming responses
  Real-time token output and tool progress
- Tool calling
  Multi-step tool loops with model calls, tool execution, and follow-up responses
- Images
  URL and base64 image inputs for providers that support vision
- Provider profiles
  Guided setup plus saved `.RASHCODE-profile.json` support
- Local and remote model backends
  Cloud APIs, local servers, and Apple Silicon local inference

---

## Provider Notes

RASHCODE supports multiple providers, but behavior is not identical across all of them.

- Anthropic-specific features may not exist on other providers
- Tool quality depends heavily on the selected model
- Smaller local models can struggle with long multi-step tool flows
- Some providers impose lower output caps than the CLI defaults, and RASHCODE adapts where possible

For best results, use models with strong tool/function calling support.

---

## Agent Routing

Route different agents to different AI providers within the same session. Useful for cost optimization (cheap model for code review, powerful model for complex coding) or leveraging model strengths.

### Configuration

Add to `~/.RASH/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agentModels": {
    "deepseek-chat": {
      "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-your-key"
    },
    "gpt-4o": {
      "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-your-key"
    }
  },
  "agentRouting": {
    "Explore": "deepseek-chat",
    "Plan": "gpt-4o",
    "general-purpose": "gpt-4o",
    "frontend-dev": "deepseek-chat",
    "default": "gpt-4o"
  }
}
```

### How It Works

- **agentModels**: Maps model names to OpenAI-compatible API endpoints
- **agentRouting**: Maps agent types or team member names to model names
- **Priority**: `name` > `subagent_type` > `"default"` > global provider
- **Matching**: Case-insensitive, hyphen/underscore equivalent (`general-purpose` = `general_purpose`)
- **Teams**: Team members are routed by their `name` — no extra config needed

When no routing match is found, the global provider (env vars) is used as fallback.

> **Note:** `api_key` values in `settings.json` are stored in plaintext. Keep this file private and do not commit it to version control.

## Web Search and Fetch

`WebFetch` works out of the box.

`WebSearch` and richer JS-aware fetching work best with a Firecrawl API key:

```bash
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

With Firecrawl enabled:

- `WebSearch` is available across more provider setups
- `WebFetch` can handle JavaScript-rendered pages more reliably

Firecrawl is optional. Without it, RASHCODE falls back to the built-in behavior.

## Source Build

```bash
bun install
bun run build
node dist/cli.mjs
```

Helpful commands:

- `bun run dev`
- `bun run smoke`
- `bun run doctor:runtime`

## VS Code Extension

The repo includes a VS Code extension in [`vscode-extension/RASHCODE-vscode`](vscode-extension/RASHCODE-vscode) for RASHCODE launch integration and theme support.

## Security

If you believe you found a security issue, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

For larger changes, open an issue first so the scope is clear before implementation. Helpful validation commands include:

- `bun run build`
- `bun run smoke`
- focused `bun test ...` runs for touched areas
